Returns a discrete flow running given discrete flow, calling given key function on each produced value, grouping values
according to keys returned by the function, and producing a key-group pair for each grouping found. A group is a flow
consuming values matching a key. Upstream values are dispatched in constant time to their group consumer.

Cancelling a group consumer makes it fail immediately. If a value is subsequently found for the same grouping, the
key-group pair is produced again, including in the special case where the consumer is cancelled while a transfer was
pending. Cancelling a group consumer has no effect when the main process is cancelled.

If upstream fails, or if the key function throws, then upstream is cancelled and flushed and the error is propagated
downstream.

When the last upstream value is consumed, downstream terminates along with each active consumer and subsequent ones.

Concurrent consumers on a single group are not allowed, attempting to do so will fail the latest consumer.

Example :
```clojure
(def words [\"Air\" \"Bud\" \"Cup\" \"Awake\" \"Break\" \"Chunk\" \"Ant\" \"Big\" \"Check\"])
(def groups
  (m/ap (let [[k >x] (m/?= (m/group-by (juxt first count) (m/seed words)))]
          [k (m/? (m/reduce conj >x))])))
(m/? (m/reduce conj {} groups))
#_=> {[\\C 3] [\"Cup\"],
      [\\B 5] [\"Break\"],
      [\\A 5] [\"Awake\"],
      [\\B 3] [\"Bud\" \"Big\"],
      [\\A 3] [\"Air\" \"Ant\"],

Returns a task spawning a reactor context with given boot function, called without argument. A reactor context manages
the execution of concurrent flows and serializes events in a succession of transactions (aka propagation turns).

A publisher is an identity representing a flow running in a reactor context. A publisher can be spawned in the boot
function or in reaction to any subsequent emission with `stream!` or `signal!`, respectively discrete and continuous.

A publisher can share the values produced by its underlying process to other publishers via subscriptions. Using a
publisher as a flow spawns a new subscription, this operation is allowed only if the publisher's reactor context is
currently executing another publisher, and the former comes before the latter in the post-order publisher tree.

During a transaction, each publisher is allowed to notify its subscriptions, at most once. A publisher is active in a
transaction if it becomes ready to transfer synchronously on a notification of a subscription in the same transaction

<TODO>
Publisher emissions are grouped in propagation turns, where successive
publishers of a given turn are strictly increasing.

 When a publisher becomes able to emit, it is compared to the
publisher currently emitting to figure out whether the emission must happen on the current turn or on the next one.
Cyclic reactions are possible and no attempt is made to prevent them, so care must be taken to ensure the propagation
eventually stops. The dispatching mechanism depends on the nature of the publisher, discrete or continuous.
* a stream is able to emit when its flow is ready to transfer and the backpressure of the previous emission has been
collected from all of its subscriptions. On emission, a value is transferred from the flow and subscriptions are
notified of the availability of this value. Until the end of the propagation turn, each new subscription to this stream
will be immediately notified.
* a signal always has a current value, thus each new subscription is immediately notified. It is able to emit when its
flow is ready to transfer. On emission, its current value is marked as stale and its subscriptions are notified if not
already. From this point, a sampling request from any of its subscriptions will trigger the transfer from the flow to
refresh the current value. Subsequent sampling requests will reuse this memoized value until next emission.
</TODO>


When a stream completes, ...
When a signal completes, its latest value is treated as the final state. Active subscriptions terminate after having
transferred this value, subsequent subscriptions transfer only this value and complete afterwards.

Calling a publisher as a zero-argument function cancels the underlying process. When cancelled, signals transfer eagerly.
Cancelling a subscription before termination makes it fail immediately with `Cancelled`.

When a reactor is cancelled, all of its active publishers are cancelled along with any one subsequently spawned.
When a publisher crashes, all of its active subscriptions are cancelled along with any one subsequently spawned.
If the boot function throws an exception, or any publisher crashes, the reactor is cancelled.

A reactor terminates at the end of the first turn where every publisher flow is terminated, meaning no transfer can
ever happen anymore. The task succeeds with the result of the boot function if no error happened, otherwise it fails
with the first error.
